      ProHits-viz is a suite of web tools designed principally to aid visualizing
      protein-protein interaction data although it can be used for any data set
      composed of conditions and readouts. The goal of this project is to make
      datasets of any size accesible through interactive visualization and a
      variety of analysis and display options.
